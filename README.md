Hi, I'm Edison. I am a programmer with a keen interest in backend, frontend, and blockchain technologies.


In recent years, I've been learning new technologies and languages.  
These are the ones I've learned so far: `Java` `ReactJS` `JavaScript` `TypeScript` `Solidity` ...



In my spare time, I also enjoy code some interesting demos, riding motorcycles, skateboarding, and traveling.

Stay passionate and become stronger. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Flexed%20Biceps%20Light%20Skin%20Tone.png" alt="Flexed Biceps Light Skin Tone" width="25" height="25" />
